- 👋 Hi, welcome to @jovita-verse!
- 👀 I’m interested in activities that keep my brain active and my soul alive.
- 🌱 I’m currently living in the GMT+08:00 zone 🌏
- 💞️ I’m looking to meet people on their paths to a data-driven world, and collaborate on smarter ways to code.
- 📫 How to reach me? Feel free to message me your ideas & questions.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers.
- ⚡ Fun fact: if you ever find me under natural shade, I am possibly re-reading T. S. Eliot's "Four Quartets" 🌳
